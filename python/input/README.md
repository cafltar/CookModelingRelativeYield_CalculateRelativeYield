  * From bryan.carlson's Google My Drive "Archive/KedarKoirala_20170331/Documents/Kedar/ORIGNAL DATA/Latest Data Files/Analysis/ Relative Yield Avg"
  * May be "best" results from Kedar's relative yield calculations by strip, with combining strips in field C as we are attempting
  * See worksheet "YearAddedAvg", column Q
* [SOC_2009Manuscript.xlsx](SOC_2009Manuscript.xlsx)
  * From Dave Huggins via email "RE: Relative Yields for legacy data" on 06/04/2020

  * Data are relative yield calculations use before Kedar's
